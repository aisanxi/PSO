# PSO
1. This repository includes the data for paper '"Joint inversion of Rayleigh wave ellipticity and phase velocity for crustal structure in Taiwan"'
2. 2008.cut.STACK.tgz and 2009.cut.STACK.tgz are the cross-correlations functions. 
3. disp_from_ANT.tar.gz contains the phase maps at different periods.
4. HV.tgz contains the H/V ratio measurements.
6. depmod.tgz contains the final shear wave velocities.
