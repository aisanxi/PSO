1. This repository includes the data for paper '"Joint inversion of Rayleigh wave ellipticity and phase velocity for crustal structure in Taiwan"'
2. disp_from_ANT.tar.gz contains the phase maps at different periods taken from Ai et al. (2019).
3. HV.tgz contains the H/V ratio measurements.
4. STA_vs.tgz contains the final shear wave velocities.
5. sta.pro.lst record the locations of the seismic stations.
